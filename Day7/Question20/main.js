/*Day 7
Question 20: Think of something you could store in an array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers,
countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.*/
var countries = ["New Zealand", "Australia", "Canada", "Germany", "Poland"]; //Stores the list of countries in a array
console.log("These are a list of countries: ", countries); //Prints a list of countries
