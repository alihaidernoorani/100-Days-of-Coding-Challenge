/*Day 7
Question 20: Think of something you could store in an array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, 
countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.*/

let countries: string[] = ["New Zealand", "Australia", "Canada", "Germany", "Poland"]; //Stores the list of countries in a array
console.log("The countries that I'd like to vist:", countries); //Prints a list of countries
