/*Day 4
Question 12: Greetings: Use the array from Exercise 11. Instead of just printing each personâ€™s name, print a message to them.
The message should be the same for each person, but personalized with their name.*/
var friendNames = ["Ali", "Zeeshan", "Bilal"]; //Stores the name in an array
for (var i = 0; i < friendNames.length; i++) {
    console.log("I hope you are having a new day, ".concat(friendNames[i])); //Accesses each element using a for loop
}
